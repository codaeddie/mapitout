# MapItOut Layout Engine Philosophy

- Node positions are always calculated on render, never stored in node data.
- Two layouts only: center (mind map) and top (tree), implemented in [layout-engines.ts](mdc:src/utils/layout-engines.ts).
- Layouts use parent/child relationships to determine node positions.
- Center layout: root at center, children alternate left/right, tiers radiate outward.
- Top layout: root at top, children in rows below, even horizontal distribution.
- All connection lines (if enabled) are drawn from node center to node center.
- No manual positioning or drag-and-drop; structure is permanent, position is temporary.
