# MapItOut Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard navigation and editing is handled in [use-keyboard-navigation.ts](mdc:src/hooks/use-keyboard-navigation.ts):

## Node Creation & Editing
- **Tab**: Create child node of selected node
- **Enter**: Create sibling node (same parent as selected)
- **Shift+Space**: Edit selected node (same as double-click)
- **Escape**: Deselect node

## Node Management
- **Delete/Backspace**: Delete selected node and its children (recursive deletion)

## Navigation
- **Arrow keys**: Navigate between nodes (basic tier/sibling navigation)

## Automatic Centering
- **Auto-center**: Camera automatically centers on selected node
- **Seamless workflow**: No manual centering needed during rapid node creation

## Important Notes
- Shortcuts are only active when not editing text or in input fields
- Editing state is managed by [ui-store.ts](mdc:src/stores/ui-store.ts)
- Keyboard navigation is disabled in Hand (panning) mode
- All shortcuts respect the current editing state and don't interfere with text input
- Camera automatically follows the selected node for optimal workflow

## Implementation Details
- Uses `useKeyboardNavigation()` hook in MapCanvas
- Prevents default browser behavior for handled keys
- Checks for contentEditable elements to avoid conflicts
- Integrates with the node selection system from map-store
- Automatic centering implemented via useEffect watching selectedId changes
