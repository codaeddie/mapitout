# MapItOut Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard navigation and editing is handled in [use-keyboard-navigation.ts](mdc:src/hooks/use-keyboard-navigation.ts):

- **Tab**: Create child node of selected node
- **Enter**: Create sibling node (same parent as selected)
- **Shift+Space**: Edit selected node (same as double-click)
- **Escape**: Deselect node
- **Delete/Backspace**: Delete selected node and its children
- **Arrow keys**: Navigate between nodes (basic tier/sibling navigation)

Shortcuts are only active when not editing text. Editing state is managed by [ui-store.ts](mdc:src/stores/ui-store.ts).
