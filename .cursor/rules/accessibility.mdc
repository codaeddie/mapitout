# Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation

This rule covers accessibility best practices for MapItOut, including ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and focus management.

- **Node accessibility:** `src/components/nodes/NodeComponent.tsx`
- **Toolbar accessibility:** `src/components/ui/Toolbar.tsx`

## Key Points

- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible (tabIndex, Enter/Space activation).
- Nodes use `role="treeitem"`, `aria-selected`, `aria-level`, and `aria-expanded` as appropriate.
- Toolbar buttons use `aria-label` and are focusable.
- Focus is managed so that selected nodes and active controls are always visible and accessible.
- Screen reader users can navigate the map structure and toolbar.
- Keyboard shortcuts are documented and discoverable via on-screen help.
